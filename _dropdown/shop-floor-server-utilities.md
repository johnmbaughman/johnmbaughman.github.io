    - [Download it!](/.attachments/ShopFloorServerUtilities-dba2ee1e-8337-4ab1-8440-539387ae3ca9.zip)
    - Unzip it!
    - Use it as described below!
- [PowerShell 7.3+ installer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)
- No more [Carbon module](http://get-carbon.org/) needed
- Split website install from scheduled task install
- Added Legacy ASN install as a scheduled task
- Additional useful utilities added

> This script can be *partially* run on desktop Windows, however, it is intended to be executed on an instance of Windows Server 2016 or above.
